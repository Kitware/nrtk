Perturbation Visualization Examples
===================================

pyBSM exposes a broad range of sensor parameters (e.g. focal length, aperture, pixel pitch, etc.)
and scenario parameters (e.g. altitude, ground range, visibility, etc.) that you can perturb.

This section includes concrete, visualizable examples of perturbations based on the large set of Optical Transfer
Function (OTF) parameters that pyBSM provides. OTF parameters can be "perturbed" to simulate different environmental
and sensor-based effects.

Each OTF covered here includes a detailed summary, a test input image, and the perturbed result image, along with a
code sample.
