v0.14.0
=======

Added a feature to use interpolation to atmospheric data, changed a
default value for JitterOTFPerturber, and modified how ``pybsm`` and
``opencv`` optional dependencies are installed.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

Documentation

* Updated README to include a reference to the ``nrtk-jatic`` package.

Implementations

* Updated default sx and sy values to 0 for ``JitterOTFPerturber``

* Added optional usage of load_database_atmosphere_no_interp in addition
  to existing load_database_atmosphere functionality

Fixes
-----

* Optional dependencies were setup in a way that ``opencv`` was missing when
  ``pybsm`` was installed, this has been fixed so ``opencv`` can be installed
  via ``pybsm`` install or as standalone for ``nrtk`` on its own.
