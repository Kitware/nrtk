0.26.0
======

* Fix: Broken links in documentation updated.

* FIX: Rename ``linspace_step`` module to be ``linspace`` to be consistent with class name

* Remove ``xaitk-jatic`` from nrtk dependencies and extras.

* Added a T&E guide and notebook demonstrating the use of the JitterOTFPerturber to simulate camera motion jitter.

* ``additional_params`` in ``PerturbImage.perturb`` is now treated as kwargs.

* Revamp the sphinx docs landing page using the ``sphinx-design`` extension to

* Add ``__all__`` to all modules.

* Add ``from . import ...`` to all ``__init__.py``.

* Added lazy importing to all ``__init__.py``.

* Added How-To guide for saliency maps in an object detection workflow.

* Pybsm perturbers now use PSNR regression testing module

* Add support for python 3.13.

* Added ``RandomScalePerturber``.

* FIX: The diffusion pipeline loader changed with ``transformers>=4.55``,

* Updated ``ccw_sort`` to use ``numpy.float128`` arrays.

* Updated ``get_bezier_curve`` to have a tolerance (defaults to ``1e-8``) for floating point comparisions.

* Updated snapshots for ``test_ccw_sort`` and ``test_regression_get_bezier_curve``.

- Added default configuration support in ``src/nrtk/impls/perturb_image/pybsm/utils.py``

- Added ``docs/examples/pybsm/data/uav_default_config_nrtk.json`` which contains the

- Added ``pybsm_default_config.ipynb`` in ``docs/examples/pybsm`` which shows how to

* Updated precommit hook config to format markdown tables.

* A new ABC was created, ``PybsmOTFPerturber``, which improves the code quality for the pybsm perturbers

* All otf calculations are now done entirely within pybsm

* pybsm caches the psf to improve performance when perturbing multiple images.

* Fixed bug where sensor jitter amplitudes were not passed to pybsm

* Removed ``cv2`` from ``WaterDropletPerturber``.

* Updated ``WaterDropletPerturber.__init__`` to use a default ``seed`` of 1.

* Removed ``water_droplet_utils.py`` and moved helper function to ``water_droplet_perturber``.

* Replaced opencv calls in pybsm perturbers with scipy

* Move custom Syrupy extension fixtures to conftest.py for reusability

* Improve readability of fuzzy Syrupy comparator

* Updated non-pybsm based perturbers to use ``PSNRImageSnapshotExtension`` for regression testing.
