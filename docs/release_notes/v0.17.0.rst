v0.17.0
=======

New ability to pass ``boxes`` to PerturbImage implementations and have the boxes
updated to reflect the translational change resulting from the perturbation. Also
removed ``pybsm`` hinges that were no longer needed because ``pybsm`` dropped the
need for ``opencv``.

Updates / New Features
----------------------

CI/CD

* Updated and applied ruff configuration.

Interfaces

* Exposed random seed parameter to ``PybsmPerturber`` allowing users to control the randomness
  of pybsm pertubations

* Updated ``perturb`` to include optional ``boxes`` argument which contains the bounding boxes for the given image.

* Updated ``perturb`` to return the image in addition to the modified bounding boxes.

Implementations

* Added ``DefocusOTFPerturber`` based on pybsm ``defocus_otf`` along with tests
