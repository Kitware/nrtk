#   the directory the notebook lives in). This path should be relative to the
#   root of the repository.
# * "NOTEBOOK_FILE" should be a list of strings that denote the notebook files
#   to be run. These paths path should be relative to the "NOTEBOOK_DIR". Files
#   in this list will be combinatorially combined with the path provided in
#   the associated "NOTEBOOK_DIR" to create a job parameterization instance.
